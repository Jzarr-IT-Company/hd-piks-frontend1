                            <li><strong>Color Correction: </strong>Enhancing colors can make the image vibrant and true to life. Tools adjust hue, saturation, and balance.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cropping:</strong> Removing unnecessary elements from the frame focuses attention on the subject and strengthens the composition.</li>
                            <li><strong>Sharpening:</strong> Correcting brightness ensures the details are visible and the image is well-lit.</li>
                        </ol>
